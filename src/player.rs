//! Player entity lifecycle management. Handles spawning the avatar with the correct components
//! and cleaning it up when leaving the gameplay state.
//!
//! All memory for components is owned by Bevy's ECS tables; this module merely issues spawn/
//! despawn commands and lets Rust drop the components automatically when the entity is removed.
